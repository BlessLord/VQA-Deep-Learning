Video Quality Assessment using Deep Learning
============================================

A Keras and Tensorflow implementation of video quality assessment using deep neural networks is proposed. We propose CNN + LSTM architecture to recognize and synthesize both spatial and temporal artifacts of video impairements respectively. The architecture is shown below.
